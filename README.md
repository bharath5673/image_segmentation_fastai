# Image Segmentation using FastAI - Segmenting eyes
Eye segmentation using FastAI

Training data: 500 images/masks over 20 epochs.

Accuracy calculation: Accuracy calculation was done by comparing the number of pixels between the ground truth and the predicted mask (ignoring the background).

Image example:
![Image](images/image.png?raw=true "Training Image")

Mask example:
![Mask](images/mask.png?raw=true "Mask - Ground Truth")
