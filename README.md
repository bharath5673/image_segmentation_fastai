Eye segmentation using FastAI

Training data: 500 images/masks over 20 epochs.

Accuracy: Achieved 95.7% accuracy.

Accuracy calculation was done by comparing the number of pixels between the ground truth and the predicted mask (ignoring the background).

Image example:

![Image](images/image.png "Training Image")

Mask example:

![Mask](images/mask.png "Mask - Ground Truth")

Output:

![Output](images/output.PNG "Output")
