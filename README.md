Eye segmentation using FastAI

Training data: 500 images/masks over 20 epochs.

Accuracy: Achieved 95.7% accuracy.

Accuracy calculation was done by comparing the number of pixels between the ground truth and the predicted mask (ignoring the background).

Image example:

<img src="images/eye.png" height="220" width="300">

Mask example:

<img src="images/mask.png" height="220" width="300">

Output:
